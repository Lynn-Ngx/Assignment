OOP Assignment - Thuy Nguyen - C15426672 - DT228/2

The aim of this assignment was to create a Sci-Fi User Interface. It could be based on a movie or create your own. The movie Wall-e inspired me to make this UI. This movie is targetted at a young audience hence my UI is also targetted for younger audience.

When the program is ran, a few images are loaded. The background colour slowly fades into a darker colour. The time is also displayed and the backgground music immediately starts playing. When the mouse is hovered over the  Wall-e image, the clip of his voice is played and it immediately stops when the mouse is else where. The Eve character follows the mouse around, and because I used noCursor(), the cursor is not shown. Little stars are displayed in the background, making it feel like the sky at night time. 

When the start button is clicked, the loading page and a loading bar appears. The image Boot is loaded and a plant is growing representing the boot and the plant in the movie. 

When the loading hits 100%, the third page appears and here you can choose the character for the game. You also have a back button to go back to the start page. Once you click on one of the characters, the game starts. You can click to shoot in the game. The score is displayed when the game is over and the program ends.
